		<p>lorem anshika is best and  do Okay, so here I am in Sublime Text, and I'm looking at the file name responsivebefore.html, which is located in the examples Lecture 24 folder. First, we're going to style a paragraph tag, because we're going to use it as our visual kind of anchor, to see where the elements fall. And basically, I'm just giving it some background color, some border and giving a specific height of 150 pixels and I'm giving the width of 90 pixels kind of to simulate some padding, so it's not going to take up the entire cell and algrid, it's going to take up 90% of it. And here actually, I'm using this little trick, to center our paragraph tag inside a block level element, which is going to be a div. And the way to center it is to make sure the width is specified, and then to give it margin right auto, and margin left auto.</p>
